# Synthetic Divergence - Evolution Simulation

üß¨ Watch primordial swimmers evolve in real-time. Each creature has unique personality traits that affect their fins, behavior, and survival.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   - Main simulation: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Dashboard with family trees: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
   - Add your own bot: `http://localhost:3000/register`

## Features

- **OCEAN Personality Traits** - Each bot's fins and behavior reflect their psychological profile
- **Real-time Evolution** - Watch traits emerge and change over generations  
- **Family Trees** - Track lineage and genetic inheritance in the dashboard
- **Interactive Controls** - Click bots for details, adjust simulation parameters

## Controls

- **Click** any bot to see detailed stats
- **Space** to pause/resume simulation
- **H** to toggle UI and bot names
- **Ctrl+R** to reset simulation

## The Science

Bots exhibit emergent behaviors through:
- **Genetic crossover** with random mutations
- **Trait-based mate selection** (similar colors attract)
- **Survival pressure** (energy management, aging)
- **Fin morphology** that affects swimming performance

Each bot's OCEAN traits determine their fin sizes and swimming abilities, creating visible diversity and functional trade-offs in the population.
- **Die** from old age or starvation

## OCEAN Personality Traits

Each swimbot has five personality traits (0.0-1.0) that affect behavior:

### üîÆ O - Openness to Experience
**Effects:** Exploration and curiosity
- **Wander Behavior**: Higher values = more varied, exploratory movement patterns
- **Search Radius**: Open bots search wider areas for food (240-440 pixel radius)
- **Movement Patterns**: More creative, less predictable swimming paths

### üéØ C - Conscientiousness  
**Effects:** Self-discipline and organization
- **Movement Control**: Higher values = smoother, more controlled turning
- **Energy Management**: Conscientious bots wait until well-fed before seeking mates
- **Greed Resistance**: Less likely to compete aggressively for food
- **Maturation**: Affects when bots reach adulthood

### ‚ö° E - Extraversion
**Effects:** Social energy and activity levels
- **Movement Speed**: Extraverted bots swim 30-80% faster than introverts
- **Mate Seeking**: More eager and persistent in finding partners
- **Competition**: Less likely to back down in resource conflicts
- **Activity**: Higher baseline energy and movement when wandering

### ü§ù A - Agreeableness
**Effects:** Cooperation and empathy
- **Conflict Resolution**: Agreeable bots yield in food competitions
- **Social Behavior**: More cooperative, less aggressive interactions
- **Resource Sharing**: More willing to give way to other bots

### üò∞ N - Neuroticism
**Effects:** Emotional instability and anxiety
- **Movement Jitter**: Higher values = more erratic, anxious swimming
- **Food Anxiety**: Lower satisfaction thresholds, seek food more urgently
- **Greed**: More likely to compete desperately for resources
- **Stress Response**: Amplifies other behavioral traits under pressure

## Behavioral States

Bots cycle through different behavioral states:

- **üîç Seek Food**: Random exploration looking for nutrition
- **üèÉ Chase Food**: Actively pursuing a detected food source  
- **üòã Just Ate**: Brief satisfaction period after feeding
- **üíï Seek Mate**: Looking for compatible partners (similar hue)
- **üíò Chase Mate**: Pursuing a potential partner
- **üíñ Mating**: Reproduction process with genetic crossover

## Genetic System

### Inheritance
- **Hue**: Visual appearance, determines mate compatibility
- **Body Size**: Affects speed, energy capacity, and maturation
- **Metabolism**: Energy consumption rate
- **Lifespan**: Maximum age before natural death
- **Preference Tolerance**: How similar a mate's hue must be
- **OCEAN Traits**: Personality characteristics

### Evolution
- **Crossover**: Offspring inherit mixed traits from both parents
- **Mutation**: Random changes to prevent genetic stagnation
- **Selection Pressure**: Only successful bots survive to reproduce
- **Population Control**: Soft caps prevent overcrowding

## Controls

- **Pause/Resume**: Stop/start the simulation
- **Reset**: Generate new random population
- **Food Rate**: Control food spawn frequency (0-3x)
- **Mutation Rate**: Adjust genetic variation (0-50%)
- **Click Bots**: Inspect individual creature stats and genetics

## Features

### Visual Effects
- **Hue-based Coloring**: Each bot's appearance reflects its genetics
- **State Indicators**: Color-coded behavioral states
- **Selection Highlighting**: Click bots to see detailed information
- **Aquatic Atmosphere**: Animated bubbles and lighting effects

### Analytics
- **Population Stats**: Track total bots, adults, children, and food
- **State Distribution**: See what behaviors are currently active
- **Genetic Averages**: Monitor trait evolution over time
- **Individual Inspection**: Detailed stats for selected creatures

### Performance
- **Spatial Hashing**: Efficient collision detection for large populations
- **Adaptive Population**: Dynamic birth rate based on current population
- **Optimized Rendering**: Smooth 60fps with hundreds of creatures

## Emergent Behaviors

The combination of traits creates realistic, complex behaviors:

- **Explorer Bots** (High O): Discover new food sources, wide-ranging
- **Steady Bots** (High C): Efficient, reliable, good survivors  
- **Social Bots** (High E): Fast-moving, active reproducers
- **Peaceful Bots** (High A): Avoid conflicts, cooperative
- **Anxious Bots** (High N): Erratic but competitive for resources

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ with modules
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas with optimized drawing
- **Architecture**: Modular OOP design for easy extension
- **Performance**: Spatial partitioning for O(1) neighbor queries
- **Compatibility**: Modern browsers with ES6 module support

## Extending the Simulation

The modular architecture makes it easy to add:
- New behavioral states and transitions
- Additional genetic traits or physical characteristics  
- Environmental factors (temperature, currents, obstacles)
- Predator-prey relationships
- Different species with unique behaviors
- Data export and analysis tools
